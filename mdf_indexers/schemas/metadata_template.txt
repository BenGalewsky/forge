# Fields can be:
#    REQ (Required, must be present)
#    RCM (Recommended, should be present if possible)
#    OPT (Optional, can be present if useful)
# NOTE: For fields that represent people (e.g. mdf-data_contact), other IDs can be added (ex. "github": "jgaff").
#    It is recommended that all people listed in mdf-data_contributor have a github username listed.
